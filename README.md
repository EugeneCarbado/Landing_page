# Landing_page
This is a project for my Udacity course work to build a functioning landing page

The objective is to:

- build a nav menu dynamically with javascript
- add an active state to parts of the landing page that come into view
- utilise smooth scrolling from one section to the other

My page is a mock up of a banking app that has certain dynamic elements for a smoother user experience
